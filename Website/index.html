Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how
Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be
All my friends call me a fool
They say, "Let the woman take care of you"
So I, try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now, oh
Oh, girl
Tell me, what am I gonna do?
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place, oh, yeah, yeah
Don't know where to go, who to see, yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Oh, girl
I guess I better go
I can save myself a lot of useless tears
Girl, I've gotta get away from here
Oh, girl
Pain will double if you leave me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
And I don't, I don't know how
Oh, yeah, mm
Oh, girl
Why do I love you so?
Yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Better be on my way, I can't stay, oh yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Have you ever seen such a helpless man? Oh, no

This is a shortcut for the start of a html file, on this file we will place the
basics for our website 

We will use css to style the website, you have to create a file and then link it
to the html file u are working on 

now lets look for some lyrics!
so here we will use pre formated text lets see how you can use it
finally there we have the embeded video 

Now it is just a matter of making it look a bit better 

usually we add an id to make it easier to locate once we are in css stylesheet

so thats how you can easily make a website for a song! Use it to dedicate a song maybe, or just to send a song to someone special!
hope you enjoyed the tutorial and have learned a bit, see you later guys

Code will be in Github!
